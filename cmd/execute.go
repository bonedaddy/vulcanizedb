	Short: "executes a precomposed transformer initializer plugin",
	Long: `This command needs a config .toml file of form:

[database]
    name     = "vulcanize_public"
    hostname = "localhost"
    user     = "vulcanize"
    password = "vulcanize"
    port     = 5432

[client]
    ipcPath  = "/Users/user/Library/Ethereum/geth.ipc"

[exporter]
    name     = "exampleTransformerExporter"

Note: If any of the plugin transformer need additional
configuration variables include them in the .toml file as well

The exporter.name is the name (without extension) of the plugin to be loaded.
The plugin file needs to be located in the /plugins directory and this command assumes 
the db migrations remain from when the plugin was composed. Additionally, the plugin 
must have been composed by the same version of vulcanizedb or else it will not be compatible.

Specify config location when executing the command:
./vulcanizedb execute --config=./environments/config_name.toml`,
